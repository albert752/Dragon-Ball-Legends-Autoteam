## Getting Started

**DISCLAIMER:** Since the progect it's in its early stages and it's not functional yet. If you whant to collaborate please contact me at albert752@airmail.cc

### Prerequisites


The Dragon Ball Legends Autoteam has been developed entierly in Python3 so you'll need to install that first:

On Debian/Ubuntu: 

First check if it's allready installed in your system:

```
python3 -V
```

If you get an output like Pyhton 3.x.x you can skip installing it, it not run:

```
sudo apt install python3
```

It is also very usefull to have pip3 installed in your system in order to get modules for python. Its is done by running: 

```
sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip
```

and the pip colorama

```
sudo pip3 colorama
```

And that's all for now, if I use any other modules or tools I'll make sure they get listed.
